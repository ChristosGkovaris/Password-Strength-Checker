# Password Strength Checker
Welcome to the "Password Strength Checker" repository. This repository contains a python-based tool designed to analyze the security strength of a given
password. This tool evaluates various password characteristics, including length and complexity, to determine whether the password meets recommended security standards.



## Instructions
- Analyze a user-provided password and determine its strength based on predefined security criteria.
- Run the program and enter a password when prompted. The program checks if the password contains uppercase
  letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The length of the password is also considered in the analysis.
  A message is displayed indicating whether the password meets the strength criteria. If the password is too short or lacks
  required character types, a message will inform the user about the specific weaknesses.



## Implementation Details
- The program is implemented in Python.
- It utilizes the `string` module to verify the presence of different character types.
- The `getpass` module is used to securely input the password without displaying it on the screen.
- The program includes a loading sequence using the `time` module to simulate processing.
- The password is analyzed based on the following criteria:
- Length Check: Must be at least 8 characters long.
- Character Type Check: Must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.



## How to Run
- Clone the Repository:
  ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ChristosGkovaris/Password-Strength-Checker.git
     cd Password-Strength-Checker
